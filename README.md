# E-Commerce Review Analyzer

This is a full-stack Django application designed to collect and analyze e-commerce product reviews. It leverages a powerful multi-model AI pipeline to distill qualitative feedback into quantitative insights, summarized praise/complaint points, and actionable business recommendations.

The frontend is a clean, responsive single-page application built with vanilla JavaScript that communicates with a Django REST Framework backend.

## Key Features

-   **‚úçÔ∏è Review Submission:** A simple and intuitive form to submit new product reviews including reviewer name, a 1-5 star rating, and detailed text.
-   **üìã Review Listing:** View all submitted reviews in a clean, scrollable list.
-   **üß† Multi-Model AI Analysis:** A one-click analysis feature that processes all reviews using three distinct AI models:
    1.  **Sentiment Analysis** (`nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment`): Predicts an aggregate star rating based on the review text.
    2.  **Text Summarization** (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`): Intelligently summarizes the key positive feedback (praise) and negative feedback (pain points) from all reviews.
    3.  **Generative Recommendations** (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`): Uses the summarized praise and complaints to generate a list of actionable to-do items for business improvement.
-   **üìä Dynamic Frontend:** A responsive interface that allows users to seamlessly switch between viewing reviews, the analysis report, and the AI-generated recommendations without page reloads.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
-   **Python 3**
-   **Django:** Core web framework.
-   **Django REST Framework:** For building the RESTful API.
-   **Hugging Face Transformers:** For local sentiment analysis and summarization models.
-   **Google Generative AI SDK:** For generating recommendations with the Gemini API.

### Frontend
-   **HTML5**
-   **CSS3:** Modern, responsive design with custom properties.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all frontend logic, API communication (`fetch`), and DOM manipulation.

### Database
-   **SQLite3:** Default development database.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
-   Python 3.8+ and Pip
-   Git
-   A Google AI Studio account to get a Gemini API Key.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-fg/Review-Analyzer.git
cd review-analyzer-project
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
# requirements.txt
django
djangorestframework
transformers
torch
sentencepiece
google-generativeai
python-dotenv
```
Then, install the packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: Installing `torch` can take a few minutes as it's a large library.*

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables
The application uses the Google Gemini API, which requires a secret key.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project (the same level as `manage.py`).
2.  Add your Gemini API key to this file:

```
# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
```
You can get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### 6. Apply Database Migrations
Initialize the SQLite database with the required tables.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Run the Development Server
You're all set! Start the Django server.
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
The application will be available at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Application:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.
2.  **Submit Reviews:** Use the "Submit a Review" form to add several sample reviews. Try to include a mix of positive, negative, and mixed feedback to see the full power of the analysis.
3.  **View All Reviews:** The "See All Reviews" button is active by default, showing a list of all submissions.
4.  **Analyze Reviews:** Click the **"Analyze Reviews"** button. This will trigger the backend AI pipeline. You will see a loading spinner while the models process the data. The results will show summarized praise, complaints, and an overall rating suggestion.
5.  **Get Recommendations:** Click the **"See Recommendation"** button. This will display the actionable to-do list generated by the Gemini model based on the analysis.
